## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "ReelRoutes turns inflight entertainment into revenue. When passengers watch a movie and see a scene that inspires them—a restaurant, a landmark, an experience—they can save it with one click. All saved moments sync to the Cathay App on landing, where they can book with cash or Asia Miles. Meanwhile, crew gets a silent dashboard showing every passenger's preferences, dietary needs, and service wishes—no asking required. It's personalized service that drives bookings, loyalty, and satisfaction."

> "This isn't just better IFE—it's a new revenue stream, a loyalty driver, and a service differentiator. ReelRoutes turns passive entertainment into active engagement, and every saved scene is a business opportunity."

**For Implementation:**

> "The frontend is ready. The API structure is defined. We just need the green light to transform Cathay's IFE from entertainment to experience gateway."
